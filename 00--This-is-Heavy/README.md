# 00--This is Heavy

Most of this assignment is getting your laptop ready for Day 1 by installing a few key pieces of software and registering for certain invaluable services like Github and Slack. Beyond that, you'll start to get familiar with Github and basic source control concepts that we'll be using throughout the class. These aren't specific to any language or toolkit; they're universal developer skills.

## Requirements

Click on this file in Github and use the **Raw** button to see the unrendered Markdown text. If you copy and paste the text _as is_ from the **Tasks** and **Deliverables** sections below into the **Description** of your issue, you should end up with a bunch of checkboxes, just like these, thanks to [the way that Github interprets Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). As you complete tasks, check off the corresponding checkboxes and what your progress bar fill! Read [Mastering Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) for more information on creating issues in Github.
