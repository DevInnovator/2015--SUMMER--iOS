# 00 -- This is Heavy

![BTTF](http://i.giphy.com/KL6leJilrOEVi.gif)

Most of this assignment is getting your laptop ready for Day 1 by installing a few key pieces of software and registering for certain invaluable services like Github and Slack. Beyond that, you'll start to get familiar with Github and basic source control concepts that we'll be using throughout the class. These aren't specific to any language or toolkit; they're universal developer skills.

## Requirements

Click on this file in Github and use the __Raw__ button to see the unrendered Markdown text. If you copy and paste the text _as is_ from the __Tasks__ and __Deliverables__ sections below into the __Description__ of your issue, you should end up with a bunch of checkboxes, just like these, thanks to [the way that Github interprets Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). As you complete tasks, check off the corresponding checkboxes and let your progress bar fill! Read [Mastering Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) for more information on creating issues in Github.

## Extracurricular Activities

Regardless of how good you think you are at typing, a lot of the mistakes you make at first will be simple typographic errors. If you _don't_ know how to touch type (i.e. without looking at the keyboard), start practicing _now_ with http://www.keybr.com/. If you're fairly confident in your typing ability, try working through the Objective-C lessons on http://typing.io

If you've finished everything above and are still looking for more, work through these intro tutorials on the C and Objective-C languages. Objective-C is called a "superset" of ANSI C, meaning that it provides full backwards compatibility with C, and extends it in several important areas. The following tutorials will give you an introduction to several concepts we will use quite heavily in class:

* [Learning C: A Primer](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/learning-c-a-primer--mobile-13916)
* [Getting Started with Objective-C](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-objective-c--mobile-13944)
