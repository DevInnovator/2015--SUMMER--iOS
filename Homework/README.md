## About Assignments

Each assignment will be delivered as a directory in this repo that contains a `README.md` file; for example, [the pre-class assignment: 00 -- This is Heavy](https://github.com/TheIronYard--Orlando/2015--SUMMER--iOS/tree/master/00--This-is-Heavy). This file will contain all the instructions for the assignment, a list of the minimal requirements, and a list of deliverables. If your work doesn't match the requirements or expected deliverables, it will be rejected. Over time, the assignments will provide fewer and fewer explicit instructions, as you will be expected to become familiar with the process. Similarly, the requirements and deliverables will be enforced more strictly.

## Turn-in Instructions

These are the default instructions you should follow for every assignment. Additional instructions or direction may be provided with a given assignment, but always ensure that you follow these steps.

* Create a **Work In Progress (WIP) Issue** in _this_ repository for every assignment
    * Name it according to the assignment name with your name appended, e.g. `00 -- This is Heavy -- Ben Gohlke`
    * If tasks (i.e. check boxes) are provided for you in the assignment file, include them as the _description_ of your WIP Issue
    * If tasks are _not_ provided for you (as in later assignments), create your own; you will be expected to break down many assignments on your own
    * Estimate the complexity, difficulty, and risk of each major piece of the assignment with T-shirt sizes: Small (S), Medium (M), Large (L), Extra Large (XL)
* _Check off tasks as you finish to demonstrate progress_; note the progress bar in [the Issues list](https://github.com/TheIronYard--Orlando/2015--SUMMER-iOS/issues) for each issue
* Create a new _topic_ branch in your `TIY-Assignments` repository for the assignment
    * Name the branch according to the assignment, e.g. `00--This-is-Heavy`
    * Ensure that you commit _all_ your work into that branch _only_
    * Push that branch to Github regularly to show progress
* Open a Pull Request (PR) from your topic branch to `master`
    * [Add a link to your **WIP Issue**](https://help.github.com/articles/writing-on-github/#references) in a comment on your Pull Request
    * Note that the PR will update automatically as you push more work to the branch
    * Do this step _as soon as you have a commit_; don't wait until the due date!

## Due Dates

Assignments are typically due at 3:30pm on the next day of class. Note that class runs Monday-Thursday, so while an assignment given Tuesday is due 3:00pm Wednesday, an assignment given Thursday is due at 3:00pm the following Monday.

Many of the assignments will seem larger than you can complete in the time allotted. Part of your job will be to analyze the assignment, prioritize sections, and apply time constraints to your work to ensure that you complete some of every part of each assignment. *Always turn in what you have by the time an assignment is due.* 

## Honor Code

You are expected to justify your own work. Even in pair- or team-based projects, you should be able to understand and explain any piece of code used by you in your project. If you copy and paste code from another student or from the web, you take ownership of that code's viability as soon as it becomes part of your project, so be sure to do so with caution. Also, if you do copy and paste code, be sure to attribute in a comment where you got this code and who authored it. Plagiarism, even of source code, is strictly forbidden.

Wholesale copying of source code and passing it off as your own work will only hurt your longterm success as a programmer and as such, will be met with severe consequences such as forfeiture of Demo Day privileges and job placement assistance.
